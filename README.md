# rmp-analysis
The goal of this project was to estimate if their are gendered differences in Rate My Professor reviews for UC Berkeley professors. The web scraping for this project was based on the framework in Samer Hijjazi's Rate My Professor Webscraping tutorial, with modifications made to fit the project goals and Python's Selenium package. As of 1/16/2024, more work needs to be done to fit a regression model that captures the relationship (if any exists at all). Further goals for the project include a sentiment analysis of reviews over time.
